# SPARQL Update

Grafeo implements SPARQL 1.1 Update for modifying RDF data. This includes inserting and deleting triples, pattern-based modifications, and named graph management operations.

## INSERT DATA

Add explicit triples to the default graph:

```sparql
INSERT DATA {
    <http://ex.org/alix> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Alix" .
    <http://ex.org/alix> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age> 30 .
    <http://ex.org/alix> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> <http://ex.org/gus> .
}
```

Insert into a named graph:

```sparql
INSERT DATA {
    GRAPH <http://ex.org/friends> {
        <http://ex.org/alix> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> <http://ex.org/gus> .
        <http://ex.org/gus> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> <http://ex.org/alix> .
    }
}
```

Duplicate triples are silently skipped.

## DELETE DATA

Remove explicit triples from the default graph:

```sparql
DELETE DATA {
    <http://ex.org/alix> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age> 30 .
}
```

Remove from a named graph:

```sparql
DELETE DATA {
    GRAPH <http://ex.org/friends> {
        <http://ex.org/alix> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> <http://ex.org/gus> .
    }
}
```

Deleting a triple that does not exist is a no-op (no error is raised).

## DELETE WHERE

Remove all triples matching a pattern. Unlike DELETE DATA, this accepts variables:

```sparql
DELETE WHERE {
    <http://ex.org/alix> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> ?friend .
}
```

This removes all `foaf:knows` triples where Alix is the subject.

## INSERT ... WHERE

Insert new triples derived from existing data:

```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

INSERT {
    ?person foaf:status "verified" .
}
WHERE {
    ?person a <http://ex.org/Person> .
    ?person foaf:age ?age
    FILTER(?age >= 18)
}
```

This finds all persons aged 18 or older and adds a `foaf:status "verified"` triple for each.

## DELETE ... WHERE

Delete triples based on a pattern match:

```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

DELETE {
    ?person foaf:status ?status .
}
WHERE {
    ?person foaf:status ?status .
    ?person foaf:age ?age
    FILTER(?age < 18)
}
```

## DELETE/INSERT (Modify)

Combine deletion and insertion in a single operation. The WHERE clause is evaluated first, then deletions are applied, then insertions:

```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

DELETE {
    ?person foaf:status "pending" .
}
INSERT {
    ?person foaf:status "active" .
}
WHERE {
    ?person foaf:status "pending" .
    ?person foaf:age ?age
    FILTER(?age >= 18)
}
```

This atomically changes the status from "pending" to "active" for qualifying persons.

### WITH Clause

The `WITH` clause sets a default graph for the operation:

```sparql
WITH <http://ex.org/people>
DELETE {
    ?person <http://ex.org/status> "old" .
}
INSERT {
    ?person <http://ex.org/status> "new" .
}
WHERE {
    ?person <http://ex.org/status> "old" .
}
```

## Named Graph Operations

Grafeo supports the full set of SPARQL 1.1 graph management operations.

### CREATE GRAPH

Create an empty named graph:

```sparql
CREATE GRAPH <http://ex.org/newgraph>
```

Use `SILENT` to suppress errors if the graph already exists:

```sparql
CREATE SILENT GRAPH <http://ex.org/newgraph>
```

### DROP GRAPH

Remove a named graph and all its triples:

```sparql
DROP GRAPH <http://ex.org/oldgraph>
```

Drop the default graph:

```sparql
DROP DEFAULT
```

Drop every named graph, and leave the default graph:

```sparql
DROP NAMED
```

Drop all graphs:

```sparql
DROP ALL
```

Use `SILENT` to suppress errors if the graph does not exist:

```sparql
DROP SILENT GRAPH <http://ex.org/missing>
```

### CLEAR

Remove all triples from a graph without dropping it:

```sparql
CLEAR GRAPH <http://ex.org/mygraph>
```

Clear the default graph:

```sparql
CLEAR DEFAULT
```

Clear every named graph, and leave the default graph:

```sparql
CLEAR NAMED
```

Clear all graphs:

```sparql
CLEAR ALL
```

### COPY

Replace the destination graph with the contents of the source graph:

```sparql
COPY <http://ex.org/source> TO <http://ex.org/dest>
```

The destination is completely replaced. The source graph is not modified. Use `SILENT` to suppress errors if the source does not exist:

```sparql
COPY SILENT <http://ex.org/source> TO <http://ex.org/dest>
```

### MOVE

Move all triples from the source graph to the destination (replacing it), then drop the source:

```sparql
MOVE <http://ex.org/staging> TO <http://ex.org/production>
```

Use `SILENT` to suppress errors if the source does not exist:

```sparql
MOVE SILENT <http://ex.org/staging> TO <http://ex.org/production>
```

### ADD

Merge the source graph into the destination. Existing triples in the destination are preserved:

```sparql
ADD <http://ex.org/extra> TO <http://ex.org/main>
```

Use `SILENT` to suppress errors if the source does not exist:

```sparql
ADD SILENT <http://ex.org/extra> TO <http://ex.org/main>
```

A `COPY` or `MOVE` of a graph onto itself (`MOVE <http://ex.org/g> TO <http://ex.org/g>`, `COPY DEFAULT TO DEFAULT`), and an `ADD` onto itself, leave the graph as it is, as SPARQL 1.1 Update specifies; a source that does not exist still fails without `SILENT`.

### Graph operations and transactions

An update of triples (`INSERT`, `DELETE` and the forms above) belongs to its transaction: the triples change when the transaction commits, and a rollback leaves nothing of them. Without an open transaction, each update commits on its own, and one that fails changes nothing.

A graph operation (`CREATE`, `DROP`, `CLEAR`, `COPY`, `MOVE`, `ADD`) takes effect at once, also inside a transaction, and a rollback keeps it. While an open transaction, the caller's own included, has uncommitted changes in a graph the operation changes (its destination, and for `MOVE` its source too), the operation fails with a write conflict (`GRAFEO-T001`): run it once that transaction commits or rolls back. `COPY` and `ADD` read their source as committed.

    ```python
    import grafeo

    db = grafeo.GrafeoDB()

    # Insert initial data
    db.execute_sparql("""

            ?person a <http://ex.org/Person> .
            ?person foaf:name ?name
        }
    """)

    # Delete specific data
    db.execute_sparql("""
        DELETE DATA {
            <http://ex.org/gus> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age> 25 .
        }

    # Verify
    result = db.execute_sparql("""
