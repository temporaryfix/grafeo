/// Detects communities with LDBC Graphalytics CDLP (synchronous label propagation).
///
/// Each node starts in its own community. In every iteration each node adopts the label that
/// occurs most often among its neighbours **as of the previous iteration**, ties broken by the
/// smallest label.
///
/// The update is *synchronous*, which is what LDBC Graphalytics CDLP specifies: an iteration
/// reads a snapshot of the labels and writes a fresh map, so no node can observe a label another
/// node adopted in the same iteration. An in-place (asynchronous) sweep is a different algorithm
/// and gives different answers — on a bipartite cycle it collapses every node into one community,
/// while synchronous CDLP keeps the two sides of the bipartition apart.
///
/// The neighbourhood is undirected: outgoing and incoming edges both contribute, and a neighbour
/// reached by several edges votes once per edge.
///
/// # Arguments
