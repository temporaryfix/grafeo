//! The direct write API: each call checked through a [`GraphWriter`] and
//! committed at an epoch of its own.
//!
//! While no transaction is open, a single call commits at once: it holds the
//! transaction manager's idle gate, so no transaction can begin meanwhile
//! and there is nothing it could conflict with, and its writes are applied
//! and stamped at its new epoch as they happen ([`Writer::Immediate`], the
//! path replay takes, lenient), which it publishes when done. Every check of
//! a single call runs before it writes, so the call cannot half-apply; should
//! it ever fail after a write, what it wrote is committed and logged, so the
//! WAL matches memory. A call that fails still uses up its epoch.
//!
//! While a transaction is open, and for every batch, a call is a private
//! transaction: one without a session, registered with the transaction
//! manager like any other (see
//! [`TransactionManager::begin_private`](crate::transaction::TransactionManager)).
//! It writes through the graph's store, recording each write in its change
//! set, and commits when the call succeeds: its changes are stamped with the
//! commit epoch, logged and reported to change data capture as a
//! transaction's are. A call that fails or panics is rolled back through its
//! change set, also a batch whose later row fails: it leaves nothing. Its
//! claims make it conflict with an open transaction that wrote the same
//! node or edge first, and an open transaction conflicts with it the same
//! way; such calls on different nodes and edges run side by side, from any
//! number of threads, beside open transactions. Like a session's
//! transaction, a call begins between commits, never in the middle of one.
//!
//! Both kinds log the same WAL records and report the same change events,
//! built from the entries their writes record.
//!
//! A database on a read-only or an external store runs each call as an
//! implicit transaction of a session instead.
