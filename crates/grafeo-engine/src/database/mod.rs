//! The main database struct and operations.
//!
//! Start here with [`GrafeoDB`] - it's your handle to everything.
//!
//! Operations are split across focused submodules:
//! - `query` - Query execution (execute, execute_cypher, etc.)
//! - `crud` - Node/edge CRUD operations
//! - `index` - Property, vector, and text index management
//! - `search` - Vector, text, and hybrid search
//! - `embed` - Embedding model management
//! - `persistence` - Save, load, snapshots, iteration
//! - `admin` - Stats, introspection, diagnostics, CDC
