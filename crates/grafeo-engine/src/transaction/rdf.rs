//! RDF writes in a transaction's change set (#414).
//!
//! An RDF update records each triple it inserts or deletes in its
//! transaction's change set, as an entry of the triple's graph, and changes
//! nothing in the store: the commit applies the entries in order
//! ([`TransactionChanges::apply_triples`]), then logs and reports to change
//! data capture the ones that changed the store. A rollback, a rollback to a
//! savepoint and a failed statement drop entries with the rest of the set,
//! so they leave nothing in the store, the WAL or the change feed.
//!
//! The transaction's reads see its own writes: [`PendingTriples`] keeps, per
//! graph, whether each triple it wrote is there once it commits, and
//! [`RdfWriter::find`] lays that over the store.
//!
//! A whole-graph operation (`CREATE`, `DROP`, `CLEAR`, `COPY`, `MOVE`,
//! `ADD`) is a standalone change (see `database::standalone`): it takes
//! effect at once, also inside a transaction, and is refused with a write
//! conflict while an open transaction, the caller's own included, has RDF
//! entries in a graph it changes.
