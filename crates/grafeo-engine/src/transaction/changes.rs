//! What a transaction changed: its change set, with the store of each graph
//! it writes.
//!
//! Every write of a transaction (a statement, the direct API of a session or
//! of the database, a batch) goes through a
//! [`GraphWriter`](grafeo_core::execution::operators::GraphWriter) that
//! applies it to the graph's store and records it here, one entry per
//! change ([`GraphRecorder`]). The set is then all a commit, a rollback, a
//! rollback to a savepoint and a checkpoint need: the commit stamps each
//! graph's entries with the commit epoch ([`TransactionChanges::stamp`]),
//! logs them and reports them to change data capture; a rollback undoes
//! them, last to first, through the same stores
//! ([`TransactionChanges::undo_after`]); a checkpoint reads the committed
//! state of what open transactions changed from their entries
//! ([`TransactionChanges::index`]). Stores keep nothing per transaction.
//!
//! The store of each graph is resolved once, at the transaction's first
//! write in that graph, and kept with the set: the commit and the undo use
//! that handle and never look the graph up by name again, so a graph dropped
//! and created again under its name meanwhile is never stamped or undone
//! with ids that mean other entities there.
//!
//! Graph commands, schema statements and the index API change nothing a
//! change set holds: each statement or call collects its changes in a
//! [`StandaloneChange`], which is checked, logged as a group of its own and
//! applied at once, also inside a transaction, whose rollback keeps it.
