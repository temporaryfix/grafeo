//! Change Data Capture (CDC) for tracking entity mutations.
//!
//! When the `cdc` feature is enabled, the database records every mutation
//! (create, update, delete) with before/after property snapshots. This
//! enables audit trails, temporal queries, and downstream sync.
//!
//! # Event model
//!
//! Every write emits a [`ChangeEvent`] keyed by [`EntityId`]. Three id
//! variants cover the three supported data models: `Node(NodeId)` and
//! `Edge(EdgeId)` for LPG, `Triple(u64)` for RDF (hashed via a
//! content-stable triple hash so the log can key events by triple
//! content without maintaining a separate id registry).
//! [`ChangeKind`] distinguishes
//! `Create` / `Update` / `Delete`; the `before` and `after` property maps
//! are populated only for the variants that can carry them (`Update` has
//! both; `Create` has only `after`; `Delete` has only `before`).
//!
//! The extra edge/label/triple fields on [`ChangeEvent`] are skipped in
//! serialisation when absent so JSON consumers see a clean shape per
//! variant. Adding a new field is a non-breaking change when it is also
//! `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.
//!
//! # Thread safety and ordering
//!
//! [`CdcLog`] is the authoritative in-memory store, a
//! `RwLock<HbHashMap<(graph, EntityId), Vec<ChangeEvent>>>` (entity ids
//! repeat across graphs, so the graph is part of the key). Readers (history
//! queries, retention probes) take the read lock; writers (commit-path
//! recording) take the write lock. We use [`hashbrown`]'s `HashMap` for
//! the Fx-hashed inner map, and [`parking_lot`]'s `RwLock` for cheap
//! uncontended locking; under concurrent insert+read the typical pattern
//! is short write critical sections (one `entry().or_default().push()`
//! per event) and occasional long read critical sections for
//! `history*()` snapshots that clone the event vector out of the lock.
//!
//! Per-entity event order within the `Vec<ChangeEvent>` is insertion
//! order, which is monotonic by construction: the only writer is the
//! commit path (see "Integration with the commit path" below) and each
//! event carries the MVCC `epoch` that produced it plus an HLC
//! timestamp from the embedded [`HlcClock`]. The clock guarantees
//! strictly-increasing timestamps across all threads within a process
//! (wall-clock ms in the upper 48 bits, logical counter in the lower
//! 16, with the logical bits bumped on collision).
//!
//! # Integration with the commit path
//!
//! A transaction's writes (statements, the direct API of a session or of
//! the database, batches) are recorded in its change set; nothing reaches
//! the log while it runs. Its commit builds its events from the change set
//! (one per change, folded into the creates of the entities it created)
//! and records them in the commit's ordered step, before its epoch is
//! published: commits complete one at a time in epoch order, so the events
//! carry the commit epoch and timestamps that follow the epochs, and a
//! reader that sees a commit through MVCC also sees its events. A rollback,
//! a rollback to a savepoint and a statement that fails report nothing.
//! Bulk imports report no events.
//!
//! # CDC epoch vs. MVCC epoch
//!
//! The `epoch` field on [`ChangeEvent`] is the MVCC [`EpochId`] produced
//! by the [`TransactionManager`](crate::transaction::TransactionManager)
//! at commit time. It is the same epoch that tags the resulting
//! [`LpgStore`](grafeo_core::graph::lpg::LpgStore) version, so
//! `history_since(id, epoch)` and `MATCH ... AT EPOCH` return a
//! consistent view. The CDC log has no epoch of its own: retention is
//! driven by external epoch advances through
//! [`apply_retention()`](CdcLog::apply_retention), called from
//! [`GrafeoDB::gc()`](crate::GrafeoDB::gc) under the same epoch used to
//! GC MVCC version chains.
//!
//! # Why in-memory only
//!
//! The CDC log is not persisted: it lives only in the
//! `RwLock<HashMap<_, Vec<ChangeEvent>>>` above, is allocated fresh by
//! [`CdcLog::new`] at database open, and a crash+recover cycle loses
//! the entire event history. The WAL replay path
//! ([`GrafeoDB::apply_wal_records`](crate::GrafeoDB)) rebuilds
//! [`LpgStore`](grafeo_core::graph::lpg::LpgStore) state by calling
//! mutation methods directly, bypassing the CDC recording sites in
//! `database::crud`, so no events are re-emitted. The WAL does contain
//! the same sequence of mutations a consumer would need to rebuild an
//! equivalent history, but that reconstruction is not wired up today.
//!
//! Keeping CDC in memory avoids a second persistent log with its own
//! crash-consistency semantics and keeps the commit path off the
//! disk-flush critical path. The retention limits in
//! [`CdcRetentionConfig`] therefore protect working set, not
//! durability; see [#250][] for the unbounded-growth incident that
//! motivated the retention knobs.
//!
//! The planned reactive event bus (see [#470][]) generalises this pattern:
//! CDC becomes one `MutationListener` among many, the recording
//! path moves behind a trait, and other listeners (cache invalidation,
//! replication, scoring hooks) register alongside. The in-process API
//! surface here is the one CDC binding that carries forward; the rest
//! of the file is effectively "the first listener".
